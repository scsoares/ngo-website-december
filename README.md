# NGO website

I tried to replicate a NGO website landing page I found on Behance (it has some layout differences from the original and it is currently incomplete). This is a class assignment project for practicing HTML, pure CSS and pure JavaScript. The original webdesign project can be found [here](https://www.behance.net/gallery/181092415/EVENT-LANDING-PAGE-(RESPONSIVE)-NGO-Website?tracking_source=search_projects|portfolio+website).

## Getting Started
